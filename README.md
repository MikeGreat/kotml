# kotml

kotml is aiming to be a machine learning library written purely in Kotlin. The motivation behind this project
was to learn Kotlin and brush up on my ML knowledge.

To install, include `jcenter()` in your build.gradle repositories.
Then in your dependencies include `compile 'com.tommypacker:kotml:0.1-ALPHA'`
